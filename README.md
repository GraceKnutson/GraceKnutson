My name's Grace (She/Her), and I work with a variety of languages and tools!

-  I’m currently working on improving my web development skills.
-  I’m learning lots about design for webpages.
-  I’d like do more work with C# and Python.
-  Fun fact: I love to do 3D modeling and animation (with Blender)!

Hope you have a wonderful day! :D
